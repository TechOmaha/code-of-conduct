# Tech Omaha Code of Conduct
The purpose of our Code of Conduct is to ensure that all participants in the Tech Omaha community have the best possible experience. We are all here to help each other learn, grow our skillsets, network and have a good time!

The Tech Omaha Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the community, in any Tech Omaha-hosted forum, private correspondence, Slack channel, event or public meeting. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

In an effort to create a safe environment for all attendees, we agree to treat each other in the following ways:
* __Be respectful.__ We expect members of the Tech Omaha community to be respectful when communicating with other community members, as well as with people outside the Tech Omaha community.
* __Be nice.__ Everyone in the Tech Omaha community should feel welcome, regardless of their background. Harassment will not be tolerated.
* __Ask for help when unsure.__ Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early can help avoid problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

## If you need help

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting <techomaha@gmail.com>, to any admin in the community Slack channel or to the organizers of an event. We take our community's health seriously and want to ensure everyone has a good experience.

When relevant - in an effort to be as transparent as possible - Tech Omaha organizers will communicate with the community about Code of Conduct violations and any actions taken. All efforts will be made to communicate in a timely manner while respecting the privacy of those involved.

Any violations, grievances, questions or concerns may also be made directly to the following Tech Omaha organizers:
